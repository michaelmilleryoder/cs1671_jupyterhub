    "# Homework 3: Large language model (LLM) prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "After completing this assignment, students will be able to:     \n",
    "* Prompt LLMs programmatically with templates (parameterized)\n",
    "* Demonstrate the difference between zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting\n",
    "* Engineer and test different prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore different prompting techniques for OpenAI LLMs. You will fill in a Jupyter notebook hosted on the Pitt CRCD to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenAI account setup\n",
    "Until the class OpenAI account is available, you will have to use your own account with free credits. You will need an OpenAI account and API key, you can [sign up here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.openai.com%2Fsignup%3Flaunch) and learn [how to make an API key here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.openai.com%2Fen%2Farticles%2F4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key). The OpenAI API is paid, however, this homework will stay well under the free $5 credit given to each account. Be careful not to exhaust your free OpenAI credits while testing. You can check [on this page here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.openai.com%2Faccount%2Fusage). To avoid exhausting your credits quickly, avoid running cells over and over again after you've completed an exercise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. Your code: the Jupyter notebook you modified from the template. Submit:\n",
    "    * your .ipynb file\n",
    "    * a **.html export of your notebook**. To get a .html version, click File > Save and Export Notebook As... > HTML from within JupyterLab. \n",
    "2. A PDF report with answers to questions provided in the template notebook. Please name your report `hw3_{your pitt email id}.pdf`. No need to include @pitt.edu, just use the email ID before that part. For example: `report_mmyoder_hw3.pdf`. Make sure to include the following additional information:\n",
    "    * any additional resources, references, or web pages you've consulted\n",
    "    * any person with whom you've discussed the assignment and describe the nature of your discussions\n",
    "    * any generative AI tool used, and how it was used\n",
    "    * any unresolved issues or problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit all of this material on Canvas. We will grade your report and may look over your code.\n",
